## ONE OF US!

Heya!

If you haven't already, check out [our awesome team](team.md), our [mission](README.md#mission-and-purpose), [
playbook](playbook.md) and [communication guidelines](guidelines.md). 

If we feel like a good fit to you, jump on our [BSDLabs Discord](playbook.md#communications) and
drop us an introduction. This isn't an interview or anything formal, but we do care about people
caring :)

We'd love to hear:

 * How you heard about us.
 * A basic background about you (interest areas, experience).
 * Background, interest areas, experience in Technology, Open Source or FreeBSD, if any.
 * Any ideas you'd like to bring to the table, or things you're super motivated by.
 * What you believe makes you a great fit for our team.
 * Any questions, comments or concerns you might have.
