# Walkthrough

## Tweetdeck
1. Someone should have invited you to the Tweetdeck team- you'll get an email like this:

2. If you click "Login to Twitter", it should take you directly to the TweetDeck homepage. I'd also recommend grabbing the [BetterTweetDeck browser extension](https://better.tw/).
3. Once you're at the TweetDeck homepage, go ahead and click "Add Column" and add a "Home" column with the @FreeBSDHelp account, like this:

4. You should now see a column with the "Home" label:

5. If I were you, I'd pop in columns for Notifications, Messages, and at least one List, so you can see everything at once:

You're all set! Bonus points if you used a \*BSD to do this- I didn't, lmao.


## GitHub
1. Someone should have invited you to the GitHub repo- you'll get an email like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26092020/140184260-60164796-fe77-45ce-9672-d7d06afccce4.png)

2. Click "Join @bsdlabs" and you're in! You can edit the [Team](https://github.com/bsdlabs/community/blob/main/team.md) and [FreeBSDHelp](https://github.com/bsdlabs/community/blob/main/freebsdhelp.md) pages to add yourself to the team. Make sure you check out the [Guidelines](https://github.com/bsdlabs/community/blob/main/guidelines.md) page too!

More bonus points if you used a \*BSD. :D
