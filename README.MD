Introduction
============

We're trialling a few folks who are keen to contribute to the
[@FreeBSDHelp](https://twitter.com/FreeBSDHelp) Twitter account. Right now the
process is fairly informal, and we're using that as a mechanism to elicit
feedback on a more fleshed out process going forward.

While we don't require minimum time commitments or deep/previous experience with communnity organizing and communication, we do have
some simple expectations that are key to what we're trying to achieve:

 * That team members participate in and as a team rather than in isolation.
 * That team members drive/champion the evolution of the team, as in "self-directed and proactive".
 * Participation that is consistent and seeks to be of high quality.

Mission and Purpose
===================

The main mission is to build a **highly-effective community organizing capability** in and for the FreeBSD Project.

While we're starting 'on social media', social media channels are only the _first test-case_ for team functions across the broader project in multiple areas, with a common and consistent community organizing framework

The broad strokes of some things we're going to need are:

1. Develop and flesh out community team and workflow documentation.
2. Develop a high-level roadmap created by the team
3. Grow the team, execute well and level up FreeBSD's community capabilities.
4. Start measuring community health & metrics over time
