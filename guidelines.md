Guidelines
==========

While the [@FreeBSDHelp](https://twitter.com/FreeBSDHelp) Twitter account is
**not** an official FreeBSD account, it does aim to be the exemplar of best
practice community engagement; commercial, opensource or otherwise.

Our tone is friendly, fun, authentic, aspirational and slightly tongue-in-cheek.
We exist to connect people and groups within the FreeBSD community with each
other, showcase the best of FreeBSD and its community members, celebrate our
wins and make progress on our challenges.

* Besides the FreeBSD [Code of
  Conduct](https://www.freebsd.org/internal/code-of-conduct/) tjat always
  applies, the following guidelines should be followed as well.

DOs
----

* DO feel free to bring your own flavour to our persona
* DO represent, not argue
* DO ask the team for advice if you're not comfortable or confident posting
  something
* DO tag tweets with a **^XX** suffix, where **XX** are your initials or a
  similar unique tag

DON'Ts
------

* DON'T bash brands, companies, individuals, or other projects
* DON'T engage negativity, unless you're **well** equipped to handle it
* DON'T share your personal information, or anyone else's
* DON'T share confidential information, including any kind of information shared
  with you in confidence or within private channels
* DON'T speculate

Things We Do
------------

* Respond to FreeBSD mentions on Twitter in a timely manner with quality
  engagement
* Amplify the contributions of community members, e.g. retweet someone's
  first issue created or port maintained
* Amplify the voice of community members, users and contributors alike
* Stimulate positive conversation and discourse about FreeBSD
* Positively amplify the work and contributions of relevant and related
  open-source Projects on Twitter
* Promote a positive, fun, and productive discourse and presence online

Specific Examples
-----------------

* SUPPORT Answer technical, organisational, or process questions asked by Twitter
  users about FreeBSD wherever possible
* CONNECT: Loop in relevant FreeBSD experts if and when we can't answer questions
  ourselves, or to provide additional context
* SHARE: Share important, pivotal, and momentous commits (src, ports, doc) or other
  changes within the community
* CONVERSE AND QUESTION: Elicit community feedback, e.g. run polls with questions relevant to the
  community
* AMPLIFY: Highlight fun, new, unique and/or specific ways people can contribute to
  the FreeBSD Project.

Ideas & Resources
-----------------------

 * Read through FreeBSDHelp Tweet / ReTweet / Reply history. Tons of different categories of content/tweets.
 * Setup a saved search like `freebsd lang:en` to monitor for new freebsd mentions. 
   Include other languages if you can communicate in that language.
 * Subscribe to [dev-commits-src-main](https://lists.freebsd.org/mailman/listinfo/dev-commits-src-main) mailing list, watch
  for important or useful commits and tweet the summary and key details. Use @username mentions to thank authors, committers and
  companies if they sponsored it or were involved in it.
 * FreeBSDHelp has a [OpenSource Projects](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1340730882705874944) list. Follow their updates via that list, share and
   amplify their wins. Example: Project birthday, big release. Idea: If the software is in ports, do a showcase tweet on that software
   and @mention them
 * FreeBSDHelp has a [FreeBSD People](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1340730882705874944) list. Follow their updates via that list, share and
   amplify their wins and updates.
 * Share and remind people about community events, conferences, meetings, upcoming stuff. 3 days before, 1 day before, a few hours before. Gives us opportunities to repeat content, grow participation, and help people not miss out.

  
Tips
----

 * Use images in your tweets whenever possible. Examples: Company or Product logos, screenshots, etc.
 * Use popular and important #hashtags, but don't overdo it. Pick the 2 most relevent, MAYBE/RARELY 3.
 * Put yourself in our followers, and the communities shoes. Always be asking: Would they find this interesting?
   Does this have overlap with freebsd? Examples: Open Source, Software,  Security, Important industry news/events
