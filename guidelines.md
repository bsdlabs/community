Introduction
============

While the [@FreeBSDHelp](https://twitter.com/FreeBSDHelp) Twitter account is **not** an official
FreeBSD account, it does aim to be the examplar of best practice community engagement;
commercial, opensource or otherwise.

Our tone is friendly, fun, authentic, aspirational and slightly tongue-in-cheek. We exists to
connect people and groups within the FreeBSD community with each other, showcase the best of
FreeBSD and its community members, celebrate our wins and make progress on our challenges.
