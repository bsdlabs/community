Introduction
============

We're trialing a few folks who are keen to contribute to the @FreeBSDHelp
twitter account. Right now the process is fairly informal, and we're using
that as a mechanism to elicit feedback on a more fleshed out process going
forward.

 1. Add people to the @FreeBSDHelp team (via TweetDeck)
 2. Add people to this repository with write access

Mission and Purpose
===================

The broad strokes of what we want to achieve is outlined below:


1. Develop and flesh out community team and workflow documentation
2. Develop a high-level roadmap created by the team
3. Grow the team, execute well and grow FreeBSD's community capabilities.

Apart from that, the aim is to have the team drive the evolution process, and
long-term, use the @FreeBSDHelp community team as a test case for community
engagement and management capabilities across the broader project, and other
channels.
