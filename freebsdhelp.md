Introduction
============

We're trialing a few folks who are keen to contribute to the @FreeBSDHelp
twitter account. Right now the process is fairly informal, and we're using
that as a mechanism to elicit feedback on a more fleshed out process going
forward.

 1. Add people to the @FreeBSDHelp team (via TweetDeck)
 2. Add people to this repository with write access

Mission and Purpose
===================

The broad strokes of what we want to achieve is outlined below:

1. Develop and flesh out community team and workflow documentation
2. Develop a high-level roadmap created by the team
3. Grow the team, execute well and level-up FreeBSD's community capabilities.

Apart from that, the aim is to have the team drive the evolution process, and
long-term, use the @FreeBSDHelp community team as a test case for community
engagement and management capabilities across the broader project, and other
channels.

Guidelines

Our tone is friendly, fun, authentic, aspirational and slightly tongue-in-cheek. We exists to
connect people and groups within the FreeBSD community with each other, showcase the best of
