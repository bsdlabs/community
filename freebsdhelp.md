# FreeBSDHelp Twitter

We're trialling folks who are keen to join the [community team](README.md)
and take the lead contributing to our [@FreeBSDHelp](https://twitter.com/FreeBSDHelp)
Twitter social media account.

Our [onboarding process](onboarding.md) is relaxed and informal, and while there
are no explicit minimum time commitments or deep/previous experience with community 
organizing, communication or FreeBSD expertise required, we do have some expectations
that are key to what we're trying to achieve:

 * That team members participate in and as a team rather than in isolation.
 * That team members drive/champion the evolution of the team, as in; proactive,
   self-directed and self-organized.
 * Participation that is consistent and seeks to be of high quality.

Check out our [team playbook](playbook.md) and our 
[communication guidelines](guidelines.md) for details on how we do things.
