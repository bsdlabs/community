# FreeBSDHelp Overview

## Introduction

We're trialling folks who are keen to contribute to the 
[@FreeBSDHelp](https://twitter.com/FreeBSDHelp) Twitter account.

This is the first practical initiative for the broader based
community organizing and communication team.

Right now the process is fairly informal, and we're using that as a
mechanism to elicit feedback on a more fleshed out process going forward.

While we don't require minimum time commitments or deep/previous
experience with community organizing and communication, we do have
some simple expectations that are key to what we're trying to achieve:

 * That team members participate in and as a team rather than in isolation.
 * That team members drive/champion the evolution of the team, as in "self-directed, self-organized and proactive".
 * Participation that is consistent and seeks to be of high quality.
