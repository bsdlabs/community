# How We Work
## Communications
- Real-time messaging:
  - [FreeBSD Discord Server](https://discord.gg/KmWB4aS8Et) (#community channel): The primary place for community discussions
  - [BSDLabs Discord Server](https://discord.gg/9vZzzxz7y9): The place for higher-level BSDLabs discussions
- Persisted documentation: The [bsdlabs/community](https://github.com/bsdlabs/community) repo on GitHub

## Documentation
- If you make a change or add something big (like a Discord channel, or a separate document in the repo, make sure it's documented in the appropriate place.
