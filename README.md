Introduction
============

## Mission and Purpose

The main mission is to build a **highly-effective community organizing
team and capability** in, and for, the FreeBSD Project.

While we're starting on social media (see [freebsdhelp.md](freebsdhelp.md)), social media channels are only
the _first test-case_ for team functions across the broader project in
multiple areas, with a common and consistent community organizing
framework.

The broad strokes of some things we're going to need are:

1. Develop and flesh out community team and workflow documentation.
2. Develop a high-level roadmap created by the team.
3. Grow the team, execute well and level up FreeBSD's community capabilities.
4. Start measuring community health & metrics over time.

## Get Involved!
We are a [bunch of nerds](team.md) who are enthusiastic about Open Source, FreeBSD, software development and a
couple handfuls of other things- if that sounds like a good community, you can join us on the [BSDLabs](https://discord.gg/N4vCmpvXzW) or [FreeBSD](https://discord.gg/zcGHGrM54f) Discord! If you'd like to kick your shoes off and stay awhile, consider [becoming part of the team](joinus.md)!
