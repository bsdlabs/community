<Add community team introduction>

Mission and Purpose
===================

The main mission is to build a **highly-effective community organizing capability** in and for the FreeBSD Project.

While we're starting 'on social media', social media channels are only the _first test-case_ for team functions across the broader project in multiple areas, with a common and consistent community organizing framework

The broad strokes of some things we're going to need are:

1. Develop and flesh out community team and workflow documentation.
2. Develop a high-level roadmap created by the team
3. Grow the team, execute well and level up FreeBSD's community capabilities.
4. Start measuring community health & metrics over time
