`TODO: <Add community team introduction>`

## Mission and Purpose

The main mission is to build a **highly-effective community organizing
team and capability** in, and for, the FreeBSD Project.

While we're starting 'on social media' (see [freebsdhelp.md](freebsdhelp.md)), social media channels are only
the _first test-case_ for team functions across the broader project in
multiple areas, with a common and consistent community organizing
framework.

The broad strokes of some things we're going to need are:

1. Develop and flesh out community team and workflow documentation.
2. Develop a high-level roadmap created by the team.
3. Grow the team, execute well and level up FreeBSD's community capabilities.
4. Start measuring community health & metrics over time.
