Introduction
============

## Mission and Purpose

The main mission is to build a **highly-effective community organizing
team and capability** in and for the FreeBSD Project.

We've started on [social media via @FreeBSDHelp](freebsdhelp.md), but
social media is just the first test-space for a team that functions
across the broader FreeBSD project in multiple areas, with a common
and consistent community organizing framework.

## Roadmap

Some broad brush strokes of what we'd like are:

1. Develop and flesh out community team and workflow documentation.
2. Develop a detailed roadmap created by the team.
3. Grow the team and level up FreeBSD's community capabilities.
4. Branch out into other and new community spaces.
4. Start measuring community health & metrics

## Join The Team!

We're a [bunch of folks](team.md) enthusiastic about the future of
Open Source, FreeBSD, Software Development and Technology.

If that sounds like you, come and join us on our
[BSDLabs Discord](https://discord.gg/N4vCmpvXzW) to kick back, hang out and consider [becoming part of the team](joinus.md)!
